# StudentOutreach
A tool for teachers to send personalized messages to students on Canvas.

## Issues with Canvas
* Canvas allows sending generic messages to groups of individuals. It would be nice to write a message with placeholders that are filled in with the student's name at the time they are sent, making the message feel more personalized.
